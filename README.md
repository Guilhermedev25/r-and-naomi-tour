## How this site was built

This website was developed using only front-end technologies, focusing on simplicity and accessibility. The main tools and technologies used are:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and responsive design (including a custom responsive stylesheet).
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features such as navigation and image carousel.
- **No frameworks or libraries**: The project was built from scratch without using frameworks like React, Angular, or Bootstrap, to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.
- **Folder organization**: Images are stored in the `img/` folder, stylesheets in the `style/` folder, and JavaScript files in the `javascript/` folder.
  The site is fully static and can be hosted on any web server or GitHub Pages.
